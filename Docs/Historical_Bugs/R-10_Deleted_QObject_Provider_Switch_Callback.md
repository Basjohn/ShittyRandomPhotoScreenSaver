# R-10 — 2026-03-06 — Widget C++ Object Already Deleted on Provider Switch (Resolved)

## Classification

- [ ] COMPLETELY FUCKED
- [ ] PARTIAL
- [ ] AWAITING VALIDATION
- [x] SOLVED

**Symptoms**
- `RuntimeError: Internal C++ object (SpotifyVisualizerWidget) already deleted` when switching Spotify provider in settings GUI and returning to the application.
- Same error for `MuteButtonWidget` and `SpotifyVolumeWidget`.
- Error occurred in `widget_manager.py` `_register_spotify_secondary_fade` closures fired by `QTimer.singleShot`.

**Root Cause**
When the user switches media providers in settings, the engine destroys the old Spotify widgets (visualizer, mute button, volume). However, `QTimer.singleShot` lambdas in `_register_spotify_secondary_fade` still held Python references to the destroyed widgets. When the timers fired, accessing any Qt method (`objectName()`, `isVisible()`, etc.) on the stale Python wrapper raised `RuntimeError` because the underlying C++ object was already deleted by Qt.

**Fix**
- Added a validity guard at the top of both `_starter()` and `_run_sync()` closures in `widget_manager.py`:
```python
try:
    widget.objectName()
except RuntimeError:
    return
```
- This pattern is consistent with existing exception handling in the file (no `shiboken6` import needed).

**Status**
- ✅ **Resolved** — No RuntimeError on provider switch in settings.

**Takeaways**
- Any `QTimer.singleShot` lambda that captures a widget reference must guard against the widget being destroyed before the timer fires.
- Use `try/except RuntimeError` around a lightweight Qt accessor (`objectName()`) as the validity check.
- This is distinct from the `Shiboken.isValid()` pattern used for background-thread callbacks — deferred main-thread timers need the same protection.

## Record Provenance

This standalone file preserves the complete former inline `R-10` record from `Docs/Historical_Bugs.md`. The chronology and technical claims are retained from that source; only heading normalization, standalone-link retargeting, and removal of monolith-only section dividers were applied during extraction.
