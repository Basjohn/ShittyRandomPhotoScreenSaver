+  - Verify `SpotifyVisualizerWidget.start()` is called exactly once and that it
+    registers a `request_overlay_fade_sync("spotify_visualizer", starter)`
+    callback on the parent before any media updates arrive.
+  - Inspect `_shadowfade_progress` and `_get_gpu_fade_factor(...)` on the
+    widget: if progress never leaves 0.0 or fade never exceeds 0.0, the GPU
+    bars and Spotify volume widget will remain invisible even if the card is
+    drawn.
+  - Check `handle_media_update(payload)` receives `state="playing"` from
+    `MediaWidget.media_updated` when Spotify is active, and that
+    `_spotify_playing` is true while music is playing.
+  - Step through `_on_tick()`: confirm it reads non-zero bar magnitudes from
+    `_SpotifyBeatEngine`, updates `_display_bars` via the smoothing loop, and
+    calls `parent.push_spotify_visualizer_frame(...)` whenever bars or fade
+    change.

+### Spotify Visualizer lifecycle & debugging checklist
+
+When the Spotify Beat Visualizer misbehaves (no fade, flat bars, or popping),
+debug in this order:
+
+1. **Card creation & primary fade** – `DisplayWidget._setup_widgets` must:
+   - Create `SpotifyVisualizerWidget` when both media and Spotify visualiser
+     are enabled for the display.
+   - Register `"spotify_visualizer"` in `_overlay_fade_expected` so the card
+     participates in the primary overlay fade wave next to media/weather/Reddit.
+   - Call `SpotifyVisualizerWidget.start()` once, which in turn registers a
+     `request_overlay_fade_sync("spotify_visualizer", starter)` callback.
+2. **ShadowFadeProfile progress** – the widget stores fade progress from
+   `ShadowFadeProfile` (card + shadow) and exposes it to the GPU path via a
+   private `_shadowfade_progress` field. If this value never advances from 0→1,
+   the card will not fade and the GPU bars will remain fully gated.
+3. **GPU fade factor & secondary wave** – `_get_gpu_fade_factor(now_ts)` on the
+   widget derives a delayed cubic fade from `_shadowfade_progress`. Bars and the
+   Spotify volume widget should:
+   - Stay at 0.0 while the card fade is in its early stages.
+   - Ramp smoothly from 0.0→1.0 after the card crosses the configured delay.
+   If bars pop in instantly or never appear, inspect this helper first.
+4. **Media state & playback gating** – `MediaWidget.media_updated` emits a
+   payload with `state` mapped to `MediaPlaybackState` (`PLAYING`, `PAUSED`,
+   `STOPPED`). `SpotifyVisualizerWidget.handle_media_update(payload)` sets a
+   boolean `_spotify_playing` gate and clears `_target_bars` only when not
+   playing so the idle floor shows while preventing motion.
+5. **Beat engine & smoothing** – `_SpotifyBeatEngine` owns a single
+   `SpotifyVisualizerAudioWorker` and per-process triple buffers for bar
+   magnitudes. `SpotifyVisualizerWidget._on_tick()` pulls bars from the engine
+   when `_spotify_playing` is true, applies time-based per-bar smoothing and the
+   current GPU fade, then calls
+   `DisplayWidget.push_spotify_visualizer_frame(...)` when values or fade
+   change. Flat bars with a healthy fade usually point to either a muted/
+   stalled beat engine or smoothing never updating `_display_bars`.
+6. **GL overlay wiring** – `SpotifyBarsGLOverlay` must be created via
+   `overlay_manager.prepare_gl_overlay` and raised after transitions; if the
+   overlay is never visible, bars will not appear even with correct fade and
+   bar values. PERF logs (`[PERF] [SPOTIFY_VIS] Tick/Paint metrics`) and
+   `[PERF] [GL COMPOSITOR]` summaries are the canonical signals for confirming
+   that frames are being produced and composited.

 ## Banding & Pixmap Seeding
 - `DisplayWidget.show_on_screen` grabs a per-monitor wallpaper snapshot via `screen.grabWindow(0)` and seeds `current_pixmap`, `_seed_pixmap`, and `previous_pixmap` before GL prewarm runs. This prevents a wallpaper→black flash during startup even while overlays are initializing.
 - `DisplayWidget` seeds `current_pixmap` again as soon as a real image loads, before transition warmup, to keep the base widget drawing a valid frame while overlays warm and transitions start.
