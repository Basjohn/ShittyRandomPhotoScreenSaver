# SRPSS | Current Plan

Live, ordered work only. `[ ]` work remains; `[~]` a candidate exists but is unaccepted (awaiting validation, never an
implicit pass). When an item lands, delete it: completed work lives in source control and its durable contract in
`Spec.md` / `Docs/` (Reference, Architecture, Guardrails, Guides); rejected mechanisms in `Docs/Historical_Bugs/`. This
is not a changelog. Deferred, unadmitted ideas live in `Future_Work.md`.

## 0. Order, scope and rules

**Work strictly in this order:**

1. **§6 Shared 3D architecture**: build reusable 3D primitives, each proven on its own harness.
2. **§7 Visualizer modes**, one at a time: **Waveform Ribbon → Reactive Liquid / Melt Pool → Concrete Rain →
   Usu Moonscape**. Each is built lab-first (§7.0).
3. **§8 Later accepted-mode reactivity polish**, only after the §7 sequence unless the operator explicitly pulls one
   item forward for a concrete regression.

**Accepted baseline (not live work):** original Bubble, Extruded Bubble, Neon Lake, Oscilloscope,
Spectrum/Rainbow Ghost, Sphere, source routing, transitions and Foundry launch buttons. Reopen an accepted
area only for a concrete new defect; deferred or unadmitted work belongs in `Future_Work.md`. Historical recovery
IDs, completed gates and rejected mechanisms belong in source control or their focused historical/investigation docs,
not in this working plan.

**Rules:** one Settings/capability/CUSTOM/render/lifecycle owner and the sole Visualizer logical clock. No new
floor, capture/DSP, renderer-side simulation, timers/polling or camera-following replacement populations. Preserve
authored presets (mutable, never test-pinned), BTF, accepted timings, parallel work and strict retirement barriers.
CLI/sidecars, never environment-variable configuration. Smallest meaningful focused test per change; the isolated
chunked suite only at milestones; no build/installer unless requested. Visual work is judged on rendered pixels against
its target (`Docs/Guides/Visualizer_Visual_Tuning.md`), and any claim of "fixed" needs the failure reproduced first.

## 5. Watchlist (observe during normal use; reopen only on evidence)

- [ ] **Display Settings capacity (physical hotplug):** on a real monitor disconnect/return or explicit reauthoring,
  Settings' current-screen rows and selections/bindings stay coherent (focused checks pass; hidden form evidence
  `tmp/pytest_ux30_display/test_display_ui_rows_follow_to0/six_display_rows.png`).
- [ ] **R38 hover display-transfer glyphs (physical topology):** watch glyph hit/tooltip/fade and transfer on
  unequal-DPI screens and monitor unplug/return (equal-DPR pair passes; `tmp/ux30_actual_displays/receipt.json`).
- [~] **Steam Games You Follow images:** many update entries lack images. Audit URLs, redirects/statuses, cache keys,
  game IDs, fallbacks, dedupe and selection order (including artwork fetched but rejected downstream); prefer
  image-bearing updates without suppressing legitimate no-image entries; instrument attrition, compare natively with
  Feeds. A generic game cover existing is not proof an image is missing.
- [ ] **Steam artwork 404** for asset hash `9b4a68b51c5f` (23 Oct MC run, `logs/run_matrix/2026-10-23_idle_hint_shaft/`)
  and earlier `4b349d51e996` / `3f5b734df3c5`: stale metadata vs genuinely missing CDN asset, before changing lookup.
- [ ] **Monitor power/wake:** display off, > 30 s off, rapid off/on, reordered return, both selected displays absent:
  widgets keep physical assignments and CUSTOM geometry. On recurrence record timestamps, remaining screen, flavour,
  Interaction Mode and wake/exit input (history: R-79).
- [ ] **Refresh contention:** correlate FEEDS/Gmail/Reddit queue/claim/publish/retire with transition delays in a natural
  dual-display trace (fairness, no post-transition stampede, retained last-good content).
- [ ] **15 s usage-sample hitch (unexplained, not reproduced):** 31 Oct 19:28-19:33 MC run, a 95-121 ms freeze of the
  GUI, render and logical threads at every `--usage` sample (20 in 5 min, `gui_stall_stacks.log` and frame trace
  agree). Each sample took ~95 ms because the sampled tree held 7 processes / 233 threads (normal 3 / ~55, ~16-24 ms);
  the four extra descendants used the GPU (counters 17 → 70), existed from the first sample and are unidentified.
  The next MC run (19:47) and an invisible live check on current code were normal. On recurrence the sampler now
  logs `[USAGE] topology added ... name= parent= threads=` for every process entering the tree: identify them, then
  decide whether the sampler must exclude/outsource them. Not the Extruded Bubble chain fix (no processes, tick unchanged).
- [ ] **Cross-display Media shortcuts** delivered once on the other display, when exercised.
- [ ] **Music recorder** 60-second clip, signal/history, cancel and mixed-DPR UI, when recording is needed.
- [ ] **Frozen release gate (operator scheduled):** Standard/Diagnostic from one compile, MC and Reddit Helper installed
  startup/exit, Settings/widgets/cache/audio and installer behaviour.
  Check installer logs and obsolete-file removal in both curated theme/preset trees. Both sources declare whole-tree
  replacement; verify Diagnostic now reads that installed theme tree too.
- [ ] **Conditional evidence only:** original Bubble tiny-radius judder (R-105) and dual-display reboot recovery
  (R-134–R-145) need new reproductions. The 90 Hz versus 60 Hz investigation stays off limits.

## 6. Shared 3D architecture (one step, before the next mode)

The architecture planned for the dropped concepts (volumetric music chamber, audio aurora/ribbon volume, photo
fracture portal, voxel morph field, holographic depth slices, procedural storm, reactive particle field,
terrain/skyline/tunnel, deformable blob sphere) is worth having; the modes were not. Build it here as shared primitives
on the existing Scene3D substrate (`Docs/Reference/Scene3D_Resources.md`): `MeshResources`, `SceneTarget`, depth-aware
OIT, probe, defocus, HDR intermediate, framed camera. Each primitive is proven on **its own offscreen harness** with
bounded, measured cost (TIME_ELAPSED, median/p90), lazy creation, zero dormant work and clean retirement; none waits for a
consumer, and none becomes a second renderer, clock or camera. Read the 3D foundation lessons in
`Docs/Reference/Transitions.md` before each slice. Order follows which mode needs them first.

- [ ] **S3D-1 Ribbon / strip primitive:** finish the reusable camera-facing width variant, shared defocus integration,
  lifecycle/admission proof and bounded cost around the existing history/ring/oriented-strip substrate. Preserve a bounded
  history SSBO, centripetal Catmull-Rom placement by continuous index, OIT translucency, multi-ribbon support and fixed
  maximum history. *Consumers: Waveform Ribbon; trails anywhere.*
- [ ] **S3D-2 Particle population extensions (G4):** inventory the existing compacted-population/sprite/streak
  helpers first; add bounded lifetimes, emitters, transient bursts, indirect draws and compute-driven arrangement
  (morphing a fixed population between shapes, from the voxel morph concept). Deterministic admission/retirement.
  *Consumers: ribbon sparks, rain droplets/crowns, melt droplets.*
- [ ] **S3D-3 Static scene geometry and materials:** authored static meshes (slabs, curbs, walls, recesses, wells,
  simple skyline/tunnel slices) with their own roughness/bevel/contact shading, built once and retained; photo-textured
  shells/planes with real depth (from the fracture portal and depth-slice concepts). *Consumers: Melt Pool chamber,
  Concrete Rain street.*
- [ ] **S3D-4 Dynamic surface field:** a bounded GPU height+velocity grid (compute or ping-pong), impulse injection,
  damping/return, a displaced mesh with normals from the actual surface, and an opt-in deformable sheet for shapes a
  heightfield cannot make (from the deformable blob sphere concept). *Consumers: Melt Pool body, Concrete Rain
  ripples/puddles.*
- [ ] **S3D-5 Reflections and wet surfaces:** a bounded planar/probe reflection for floors and pools, wet-surface and
  puddle masks over authored ground, and reflection-distortion sampling driven by a surface field. No screen-space trick
  that collapses under camera motion. *Consumers: Waveform Ribbon floor (next: §7.1), Melt Pool, Concrete Rain.*
- [ ] **S3D-6 Shared shadows (G2 / S25):** one fitted directional depth map, bounded soft PCF/bias, caster/receiver
  admission, resize/teardown/dormancy and tier cost on a real test scene (also Usu's S25; not a revival of the rejected
  Extruded cast shadows).
- [ ] **S3D-7 Reduced-resolution volumes, then lightning (G5):** prove the bounded static fog slice required by Waveform
  Ribbon first, with no audio reactivity. Then add bounded procedural bolt geometry/light and fog/smoke volumes with
  advection/reprojection and no permanent extra targets or separate cadence. *Consumers: chamber/street atmosphere.*

## 7. Visualizer modes (one at a time, in this order)

### 7.0 Method: lab first, then production

Extruded Bubble's lab (`tools/labs/extruded_bubble_lab.py`) reached the mocks long before production did; production
then closed the gap by measuring against both. Do the same for every new mode:

1. **Target first:** the mock/concept package and its low/high pair; write the mode's contract and hard gates (from its
   brief) into its focused doc before code.
2. **Lab:** `tools/labs/<mode>_lab.py` composes the target scene by hand, offscreen, from the shared primitives, with
   free knobs and no Settings/preset plumbing. Reuse the context/target and ownership contract in
   `Docs/Guides/Visualizer_Labs.md`. Iterate on rendered stills (mock | lab sheets) until it is close.
3. **Production through the shared substrate:** typed Settings, presets, the logical clock and lifecycle. Diff the lab's
   effective knobs against production's key by key; judge with **mock | lab | ours** sheets per preset, the per-mode
   capture tool (`tools/<mode>_capture.py` on recorded real music) and measurements (regional colour, on-screen size
   bands, Range audits), as in `Docs/Guides/Visualizer_Visual_Tuning.md`.
4. **The lab is a waypoint, not the goal:** keep going toward the mock; keep the lab (it costs the product nothing).
5. **Same-scene low/high proof, measured cost, dormancy and retirement** before calling any stage done, including the
   live-shape check under the calibrated game load (`tools/visualizer_live_check.py --load game60`, budgets in
   `Docs/Guides/Visualizer_Change_Checklist.md` 1C); the operator gives final sign-off.

### 7.1 Waveform Ribbon (next)

Chosen first: the smallest contained scene and the first consumer of S3D-1/S3D-2/S3D-5. Brief and hard gates:
`Docs/Future_Work/Waveform_Ribbon.md`. The detailed working checklist and visual target custody live in
`Docs/Reference/Waveform_Ribbon_Lab_Plan.md`; reference packages under `references/` are local/operator-owned and are
intentionally absent from normal GODZIPs.

The scene is world-first through the shared framed camera (Orthographic default): wet reflective concrete floor,
waveform and strong thick shaped mist, with no visible horizon/sky/floor edge. The waveform clears and softly lights
the mist. Preset/control migration and recorded-audio calibration come only after the lab look is credible.

- [~] **Primary lab look:** close the remaining mist continuity/interior-volume, floor-contact/reflection, edge crackle,
  sheet saturation and fog-cost gaps against the complete-scene target.
- [~] **Alternate lab look:** retain distinct broad ribbon identities, free rim-attached strands, glow and floor contact;
  close its remaining highlight/mist-edge fidelity gaps without regressing the primary look.
- [ ] **Accents and optics:** finish sparks/glow/defocus only after waveform, floor and mist remain credible without them.
- [ ] **Visual admission:** operator/capable visual-agent sign-off on the floor/waveform/volume range before live reactivity.
- [ ] **Core-reactivity bake-off:** before committing WR-07 to one geometry/motion language, retain the concept brief's
  current bass-width/slow-bend + mids-twist/centerline + highs-fine-detail + transient-curvature mapping as Candidate A
  and compare it with three bounded alternatives in the lab: traveling deformation packets, elastic/tension dynamics,
  and authored macro-flow with subordinate waveform-derived fine structure. Hold colour shifts, particles and glow
  constant/off for this decision. Drive every candidate with the same deterministic 10-second synthetic program; export
  one short WebP plus five synchronized stills per candidate at identical camera/world/time checkpoints. Judge musical
  separation, low-react beauty, attack/settle, continuity, silhouette readability and cost. Choose one core grammar, or
  combine candidates only when the evidence shows complementary behavior rather than extra noise. Detailed contract:
  `Docs/Reference/Waveform_Ribbon_Lab_Plan.md` §5.1.
- [ ] **Only after the bake-off selects the core grammar:** recorded-audio WR-07 calibration, remaining S3D-1/2/5
  lifecycle/cost gates, WR-08 production migration/tunable presets, then WR-09 acceptance with
  `tools/visualizer_live_check.py --load game60`.

### 7.2 Reactive Liquid / Audio Melt Pool

A heavy viscous molten body in a real concrete chamber; must never read as Neon Lake water. Brief and hard gates
H01–H14: `Docs/Future_Work/Melt_Pool.md` (mock in `references/Reactive_Liquid_Audio_Melt_Pool_Concept_and_Architecture.zip`).
Uses S3D-3 (chamber), S3D-4 (surface field), S3D-5 (reflections), S3D-2 (droplets).

- [ ] Stages with stop points: static chamber + framed camera → connected viscous surface → musical pressure and peaks
  (decide whether a deformable peak mesh is needed) → material/environment interplay → droplets, Settings, acceptance.

### 7.3 Concrete Rain

Rain on a night street: music changes the pavement's water, never the street. Contract: `Docs/Future_Work/Concrete_Rain.md`
(reference `references/Low and High Reactivity Concrete Rain Comparison.png`, left low / right high). Reuses S3D-3
(street), S3D-4 (ripples), S3D-5 (wet surface, reflections), S3D-2 (impacts, crowns, droplets).

- [ ] Stages: wet surface and reflection → ripples and impact rings → splash crowns/droplets → music mapping (density,
  impact energy, ripple complexity, reflection disturbance) → scene assembly and acceptance against the reference.

### 7.4 Usu Moonscape (eventual)

Long-horizon character/world vertical: `Docs/Future_Work/Usu_Moonscape.md` (Blender work:
`Docs/Future_Work/Usu_Blender_Work.md`). Needs the character/world foundations S19–S27 listed there (asset bake,
skinning, animation graph, secondary motion, felt/fuzz, world-view projection, sphere world/starscape) plus S3D-6.
Not admitted until those foundations are proven; the static silhouette approval stays a separate hard gate.

## 8. Later accepted-mode reactivity polish

Do not pull these ahead of the §7 mode sequence unless the operator explicitly reprioritizes them. They are admitted
follow-up work on the accepted original Bubble, not a reason to reopen unrelated Bubble behavior.

- [ ] **Original Bubble drift intensity range:** normal Bubble drift works, but its visible drift strength is too similar
  at idle and under heavy/intense sound despite the authored settings. Trace signal → reactive target → smoothing → final
  displacement/speed before tuning. Preserve the accepted idle drift and cadence, then make the configured high-react
  end materially stronger under sustained loud passages and strong transients without introducing jumps, judder or a
  separate clock. Prove quiet/mid/hot synthetic fixtures plus recorded real-music passages and compare the actual
  low-to-high drift range, not only a single loud frame.
- [ ] **Original Bubble scalar-to-range control audit:** inventory Bubble sliders whose authored value is really a
  low-react/high-react envelope and convert only semantically appropriate controls to range sliders. Wire the low and
  high handles to the canonical reactivity signal rather than treating the range as cosmetic UI. For authored presets
  **1-8 only**, seed both ends of every migrated range from that preset's existing scalar value so the migration is
  byte-identical to its current output before the operator widens a range; presets beyond 8 are experimental and do not
  constrain migration. Capture the pre-change P1-P8 effective values and fixture frames as the regression oracle, then
  prove Save/Cancel/Restore, preset switching, CUSTOM editing and low/high interpolation without changing unrelated
  Bubble reactivity semantics.

## Operator execution and evidence rules

Use direct-copy, single-line PowerShell commands with explicit `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` for the operator. Keep
details and evidence at their focused owner, this checklist actionable, and `Index.md` / `Spec.md` navigation current.
No memory updates without an explicit request.
