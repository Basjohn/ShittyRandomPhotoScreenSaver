# Current Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-03

This file tracks active work only. Long-lived architecture truth belongs in `Spec.md`; dated bug narratives belong in `Docs/Historical_Bugs.md`.

## Guardrails

- Keep this aligned with `Spec.md`, `Index.md`, `Docs/Guardrails.md`, `Docs/Historical_Bugs.md`, and `Docs/Harness_Index.md`.
- Prune validated work aggressively. This is not a changelog.
- Prefer automation bars over repeated runtime-verification asks.
- Fallbacks must stay loud and routed through the relevant CLI family; a fallback is evidence, not success.
- UI pressure is barred as a perf fix. Do not add repaint/update requeue loops, rescue timers, or broad UI refreshes to chase FPS.
- Fullscreen / one-pixel shrink / startup-flash behavior is frozen at last committed behavior unless explicitly greenlit through a document-first audit.
- Before touching shared visualizer/audio/activation/render/transition seams, run the focused visualizer reactivity lock from `Docs/Harness_Index.md`.

## Active Tasks

No active implementation task is currently queued. Await the next selected proposal.

## Watchlist

- [ ] Performance cadence: preserve fresh evidence if Display 0 falls into a suspicious near-60 visible cadence, Display 1 into near-40 under-delivery, or the parser reports paint starvation, overlay under-delivery, swap-interval warnings, shader/cache fallbacks, or repeated app-shared `AnimationManager` under-target windows with actionable `active_labels`.
- [ ] Visualizer timing: if `--viz` logs show slow `_on_tick` phase breakdowns, fix the named owner directly; if only tick gaps appear, treat it as event-loop/timer delivery pressure rather than visualizer work.
- [ ] Reddit cadence: in the next long compiled run, confirm both widgets fire near due cadence, sparse HTML does not become the repeated primary source after partial rescue, and failed/empty chains do not freshen cache timestamps.
- [ ] Visualizer CUSTOM geometry route repair: reopen only if fresh logs show repeated bucket repair, duplicate-owner fallback, requested-monitor fallback, replay-green/runtime-wrong geometry, or settings-return suppression/stranding.
- [ ] Display wake / monitor recreate: keep the latest behavior accepted unless black-background recovery, missing compositor surfaces, duplicate displays, or placeholder truth returns.
- [ ] Settings runtime restart: reopen only if deleted Qt wrapper errors, stale background hydration, or settings-exit runtime bleed returns in `--set` / main logs.
- [ ] Sources / RSS reset: validate that "Just Make It Work" preserves existing RSS cache, emits one deferred source-change during settings, and settings exit performs only one clean source/RSS initialization without stranding media or visualizer.
- [ ] Non-`Custom` authored stacking: default-on for new users; re-audit with `--geo` only if authored-layout collision behavior reopens.
- [ ] Oscilloscope, Spectrum, Sine Waves, Bubble, and Dev Curve: accepted current behavior. Reopen mode-owned work only with fresh `--viz` evidence.
- [ ] Media metadata preservation during live visualizer preset churn: if it reopens, first suspect partial same-track playback snapshots during visualizer-only settings writes.

## Deferred / Not Active

- [ ] Feeds widget family architecture track:
  - [ ] Keep Reddit as its own branded widget and shared runtime owner; do not replace it with Feeds.
  - [ ] Extract reusable list-feed seams from Reddit without changing Reddit UX first.
  - [ ] Design Feeds as an additional widget family with isolated per-spawn source/cache/settings contracts.
  - [ ] Prefer official/feed-native sources and avoid HTML scraping/session automation by default; Reddit HTML is the explicit paced exception because Reddit's structured public endpoints are fragile.
- Dynamic Volume Floor follow-up stays deferred.
- Startup update-policy observability stays deferred behind current runtime-health priorities.
- Secure-desktop long-runtime exit reliability stays deferred.

## Documentation Rule

- Architecture: `Spec.md`
- Module map: `Index.md`
- Policy: `Docs/Guardrails.md`
- Dated regressions: `Docs/Historical_Bugs.md`
- Drift-check routine: `Docs/Documentation_Maintenance.md`
- Harness reference: `Docs/Harness_Index.md`
- Runtime health audit: `audits/ArchitectureAudit/Project_Health_Audit.md`
- Historical geometry audit: `audits/GeoAudit/Visualizer_Runtime_Shape_Audit.md` when geometry/runtime replay issues reopen
- Bubble preset/runtime audit: `audits/BubbleAudit/Bubble_Preset_Runtime_Audit.md` as historical authored-setting reference
- Bubble historical audit reference: `audits/BubbleAudit/Bubble_End_To_End_Audit.md`
- Oscilloscope visual/reactivity audit: `audits/OscilloscopeAudit/Oscilloscope_End_To_End_Audit.md`
